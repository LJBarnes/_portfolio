# Portfolio
I created this portfolio to showcase my projects, tell a little about myself, and provide contact information for potential employers and clients. 

# Styling
Basing this portfolio off of a basic portfolio I previously created with HTML and CSS, I used Bootstrap classes and media queries to make the pages and images therein responsive to different screen sizes. I condensed my portfolio, about me, and contact pages into one page and linked the sections to the navigation links. Bootstrap's scrollspy feature was added to update the nav bar links based on scroll position to indicate which link is currently active.

# JavaScript
Using jQuery, I added smooth scrolling  when the links are clicked on the navbar.
